Simple batch script to install and update seemless coop





All you have to do is change DEST_PATH to wherever your game is installed by opening steam -> rightclicking elden ring -> manage -> browse local files -> click into the folder "game" -> copy the path -> paste it where promted in the .bat file





You can move the file anywhere, I just keep it on the desktop for ease of use but it comes up in search no problem. You can also rename the file for easier access
